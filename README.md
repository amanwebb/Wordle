## Wordle Helper

I wanted to create a script to 1) play Wordle with friends more than just once a day, and 2) help get the actual Wordle every single time. 

It is a pretty simple code where you just compare guesses to the actual word. How it is written as of now, you can play two-player wordle or use it while playing the game online. You simply type in your guess then the colors (results) of your guess. This continues until you reach your six guesses (which hopefully never happens with this code). 

You have to import a list of five letter words. You can find that csv file in this repo. The game compares your guess to all of those words. And there are a lot of words!

Eventually I want have a script where you can play wordle as often as you want by yourself (against the computer) but for now, you will need to have a second player or the daily game itself.

Enjoy winning every day you play!
